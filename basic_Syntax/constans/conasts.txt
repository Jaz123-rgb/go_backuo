the const keyword declar the variables as "constans", wich means that it is unchangke and read-only 
 
 the constat has two types 
 Typed constans
 unTyped constans

 Example Type constans:

 package main 
 import (
    "fmt"
 )

 const A int = 1

func main(){
    fmt.Println(A)
}

#unTyped constants#

package main 

import(
    "fmr"
 )

const A = 1

func main(){
    fmrt.Println(A)
}

the big difference is when you declare the variable in one, you specify the type of content and the other 
just declare the variable, and go decide the value of them
